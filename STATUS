Current status
==============

General issues
  - No dynamic recompilation yet
  - Slow (not performance optimized yet at all. See above).
  - No I/O timing whatsoever except at a timeslice level for audio/video.
    (ie DMA, rendering, GD-Rom operations need to take > 0 ms to complete)

SH4 Core
  + Base instruction set  (Complete?)
  - No MMU support (address translation, TLB, etc)
  - No user-mode support
  - Not remotely cycle-correct timing

SH4 On-chip peripherals 
  BSC
    * Not implemented except for PCTRA/PDTRA, and that part is quite dodgy.
  CPG
    * Complete?
  DMAC
    * Implemented to extent needed by ASIC DMA, not fully complete
  INTC
    * Complete?
  RTC
    * Not implemented
  SCI
    * Not implemented (not even hooked up in the hardware?)
  SCIF
    * Complete? (not heavily tested)
  TMU
    * Complete?
  UBC
    * Not implemented

AICA SPU
  ARM core
    + Base instruction set (Complete?)
    - No thumb support
    - No system coprocessor support
    - No cycle-correct timing
  DSP
    + Basic sound generation
    - No waveform support
    - No LFO support

PVR2 GPU
  TA
    + Quick-n-dirty hack job to store the TA command lists in the poly
      buffer and nothing else. Not remotely correct. 
    - Doesn't support 16-dword vertexes
  Render
    + Basic opaque and translucent polygon support
    + Depth buffer, alpha blend, most poly modes
    - No translucent poly sorting
    - No modifier volumes
    - No sprites
    - No specular highlight
    - No 16-dword vertexes
  Texture
    + Most texture formats supported
    - No support for VQ decompression

GD-Rom
  IDE interface
    + Supports Ident, Set feature, and Packet (and no other IDE commands)
    + Supports PIO and DMA modes
  GD-Rom interface
    + Supports Test ready, Ident, Read TOC, Read Session info, Sense request, and Read CD
      commands
    - other 20-odd commands not supported

Maple
  + Maple bus complete?
  + Standard DC controllers
  - No support for VMU
  - No support for other controller types (keyboard, mouse, gun, etc)

Network
  - Not implemented
