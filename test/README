The test cases in this directory require an sh4 tool chain, as well as an
arm tool chain if you want to build the AICA tests. The default Makefile
assumes these are sh-elf and arm-elf targets respectively. A modified copy of
newlib 1.8.2 prebuilt for SH4 with dc-load support is included as well,
to save having to set up that part of the environment. The necessary patch
is in the lib directory if you wish to build from source (newlib is included
under the terms of the GPL)

crt0.s is included from the dcload distribution, and is assumed to be
redistributable under the terms of the GPL.

There is currently no configure/automake for this directory - you'll need to
modify the Makefile directly if needed. This should probably be changed
eventually
