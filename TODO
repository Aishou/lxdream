Immediate stuff to look at:

  * Disassemble ARM boot program, print out, analyze
  * Disassemble SH4 region in question as well actually.
  * Write ARM loader + test program, test on actual DC.

  * IDE/GDRom drive
     - cd-file interface (cdi, bin/cue, , nrg, mds, etc)

And then
  * Add load/save button to memory viewer
  * EXTDMA unit
  * PowerVR chip
  * Sound chip
      - ARM7trm cpu core (yeah, this one will be fun)
      - DSP side
  * network adapter
