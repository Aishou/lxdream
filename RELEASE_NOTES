Release notes for Milestone 2 
===================================================

Please note that this is a development release - many 
things are not yet implemented, it's still quite slow, and not
particularly user-friendly. Framerates are typically 4-5 frames 
per second on a 3Ghz P4. If you're looking for something to just
play DC games, you'll probably want to wait for the next version.

Having said all that, some games are known to run to at least 
some degree (aka everything we've tried), and most homebrew works 
perfectly, albeit slowly - feel free to experiment and let us 
know how it goes.

Changes since Milestone 1
-------------------------
* Complete rewrite of nearly all PowerVR2 code - The M1 code was largely a
quick hack to get something running. It's done for real now.
* Initial IO event system (not widely used yet)
* Lots of bugfixes throughout the system

Known issues
------------
The following are known bugs (as opposed to missing features) that will be
fixed in the next release, but are too large to be fixed for this version:

* Some games experience geometry corruption of varying levels. This is
believed to be caused by an SH4 core bug.

* Polygons that are partially clipped by the view frustum can be distorted
quite badly

System requirements
-------------------
GTK 2.0+
Gnome 2.0+
ESounD 2.36+  (if you want interrupted stuttery sound[0])
OpenGL drivers with EXT_framebuffer_object support (any recent drivers should be
fine)
GCC, Make, etc.

Building
--------
From the base directory
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ make install            (optional)

Enjoy!
