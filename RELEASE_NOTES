Release notes for lxdream 0.9 "Shiny"
===================================================

Lxdream 0.9 is considerably more stable and accurate than the 0.8 series
(thanks more to a huge number of bugfixes than anything else), and the 
majority of software can be expected to "just work" with minimal problems. 

Nevertheless this should still be considered an alpha release, with many 
unimplemented features remaining. You're unlikely to see 'perfect' emulation,
and we're nowhere near being bug-compatible (in other words, don't expect your
code to work on the real hardware just because it runs correctly in lxdream).

Changes since 0.8.4
-------------------
* Improved accuracy + compatibility (many bugfixes)
* Shadow volumes
* Render-to-texture support
* Fogging
* Light-gun support

Known issues
------------
The following are known problems in 0.9 that will be fixed in the next major
release - in other words, you don't need to report them - we already know :)

* Graphic artifacts related to translucent triangle intersections, sorting errors 
  and/of lack of depth precision.

* MMU address translation (eg linux, wince, etc) is painfully slow to the
  point of unusability. 

* The SH4 emulation is not cycle accurate, and (by default) usually runs
  slower than the real one. This cause some programs to have timing problems
  or to break completely. In some cases this can be worked around by
  adjusting the CPU scaling factor (-m command line option)

* Audio quality generally ranges from poor to horrible, interrupted by the
  occasional bit of fair-to-middling sound. 

System requirements
-------------------
Linux:
   GTK 2.6+
   Current (2008 or later) ATI or NVidia binary OpenGL drivers 
      - If anyone wants to fix the free drivers, lxdream specifically
        requires a working implementation of either the EXT_framebuffer_object
        or GLX_SGIX_pbuffer extensions. 

OS X:
   System 10.4 or later

GCC, Make, etc.

Building
--------
From the base directory
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ make install            (optional, GTK only)

Enjoy!


Older History
================

Changes since 0.8.3
-------------------
* Fullly native Mac OS X support
* Renderer rewrite (fixes perspective correction among other problems)
* ALSA and PulseAudio sound drivers
* Save states now work on x86-64
* New translations: Spanish and Italian
* Lots of miscellaneous bug-fixes and improvements

Changes since 0.8.2
-------------------
* MMU Implementation
* Dreamcast mouse + keyboard support
* Joystick/gamepad support
* Assorted bug-fixes

Changes since 0.8.1
-------------------
* x86-64 architecture support
* Preliminary Mac OS X support
* Pbuffer support (to support OpenGL drivers without EXT_framebuffer_object)
* Support for more recent CDI and NRG image file versions
* Minor bugfixes

Changes since 0.8
-----------------
* Various configure/build fixes for compatibility
* GDI image support
* Minor bugfixes

Changes since Milestone 3
-------------------------
* Speed improvements (translation core now runs at roughly double the speed
  of M3)
* GUI Overhaul - it's actually somewhat usable now. Also removed the gnome
  dependency (now just needs GTK 2.0)
* Sound fixes (aka, some sound actually works now)
* A few minor bugfixes and tweaks.

Changes since Milestone 2
-------------------------
* Implemented the SH4 translation core
* A handful of minor bugfixes

No really, that's it. The good stuff is coming next version, honest

Changes since Milestone 1
-------------------------
* Complete rewrite of nearly all PowerVR2 code - The M1 code was largely a
quick hack to get something running. It's done for real now.
* Initial IO event system (not widely used yet)
* Lots of bugfixes throughout the system
