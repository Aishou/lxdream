Release notes for lxdream 0.8
===================================================


Please note that this is an alpha release - many things are not yet 
implemented, it has many bugs (especially wrt rendering), and it's
not likely to run at 100% speed.

Having said all that, some games are known to run to at least 
some degree (aka everything we've tried), and most homebrew works 
perfectly or nearly so - feel free to experiment and let us 
know how it goes.

Changes since Milestone 3
-------------------------
* Speed improvements (translation core now runs at roughly double the speed
  of M3)
* GUI Overhaul - it's actually somewhat usable now. Also removed the gnome
  dependency (now just needs GTK 2.0)
* Sound fixes (aka, some sound actually works now)
* A few minor bugfixes and tweaks.

Changes since Milestone 2
-------------------------
* Implemented the SH4 translation core
* A handful of minor bugfixes

No really, that's it. The good stuff is coming next version, honest

Changes since Milestone 1
-------------------------
* Complete rewrite of nearly all PowerVR2 code - The M1 code was largely a
quick hack to get something running. It's done for real now.
* Initial IO event system (not widely used yet)
* Lots of bugfixes throughout the system

Known issues
------------
The following are known bugs (as opposed to missing features) that will be
fixed in the next release, but are too large to be fixed for this version:

* Polygons that are partially clipped by the view frustum can be distorted
quite badly
* Limited depth precision causes tearing of view on some scenes.

System requirements
-------------------
GTK 2.0+
ESounD 2.36+
OpenGL drivers with EXT_framebuffer_object support (any recent drivers should be
fine)
GCC, Make, etc.

Building
--------
From the base directory
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ make install            (optional)

Enjoy!
