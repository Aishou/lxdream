Release notes for Milestone 1 ("Smoke and Mirrors")
===================================================

This is an early development release. Most things don't work. Many things
that do work only do so by sheer luck. Framerates are typically 1-4 frames
per second on a 3Ghz P4. In short, don't expect to run any actual games on
it at this stage (I have not even tried, myself).

Having said that, the following are known to run with at least some degree of 
success:

  * Most KOS based demos, and a number of other demos (An exact inventory of 
working demos is not being maintained at this stage).
  * The BIOS bootstrap (you can boot NRG and CDI cd-rom images)

System requirements
-------------------
GTK 2.0+
Gnome 2.0+
ESounD 2.36+  (if you want interrupted stuttery sound[0])
GCC, Make, etc.

[0] Actually the ARM chip can be run independently, in which case the
performance is reasonably decent.

Building
--------
From the base directory
~$ ./configure
~$ make
~$ make install            (optional)
