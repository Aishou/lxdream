None of this would have been possible without the work of many people in the
dreamcast homebrew community, for whom I have the utmost respect. In
particular, I'd like to thank:

* Marcus Comstedt (http://mc.pp.se/dc/) for much educational documentation

* Andrew Kieschnick (http://adk.napalm-x.com/dc/index.html) for the invaluable
  dcload-ip utility.

* Maiwe (http://www.ludd.ltu.se/~jlo/dc/) for the excellent PVR2 and AICA
documentation

* bITmASTER (http://www.fuzzymuzzle.com/Bitmaster/bITmASTERs_dCdeV.htm) for
(among other things) the SPU dma examples.

And of course, last but by no means least
* Dan Potter (http://cadcdev.sourceforge.net/) for almost single handedly
jump starting the DC homebrew scene with libdream and KOS
